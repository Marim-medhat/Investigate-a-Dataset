# Investigate a Dataset
 
In this project, i will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it.
i will use the Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib).
## Data Set 
TMDb movie data
(cleaned from original data on Kaggle)
https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

## Overview and Notes
This data set contains information
about 10,000 movies collected from
The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.
● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time.
